Step 2: Read input marks as m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6
Step 3: Read input as percent
Step 4: set percent:=(m1+m2+m3+m4+m5+m6)/6
step 5: IF percent>=75
             print("student got A grade")
        ELIF percent>=65
             print("student got B grade")
        ELIF percent>=35
             print("studennt got C grade")
